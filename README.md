# cache_simulator
Using trace files which model real memory calls, this project simulates directly mapped, fully associative, 2-way set associative, and 4-way set associative caches. Also implements first in first out and least recently used replacement algorithms. Plots the hit rate or time elapsed while changing different variables such as block size and cache size to model the performance of the different cache types and replacement algorithms and the effects of different variables on this performance.
